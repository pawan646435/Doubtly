## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** >= 18.x
- **MongoDB** running locally or a MongoDB Atlas connection string
- **Google Gemini + NVIDIA Kimi API Keys** (from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com))
  - `NVIDIA_API_KEY` for Gemma
  - `NVIDIA_QWEN_API_KEY` for Qwen (recommended for best routing)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Doubtly
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your MONGODB_URI + API keys
# - GEMINI_API_KEY (Google Gemini)
# - KIMI_API_KEY (NVIDIA Kimi)
# Optional: DB_FALLBACK_MODE=file to run without local MongoDB
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Application
Open **two terminals**:

**Terminal 1 — Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 — Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at: **http://localhost:5173**

## ▲ Deploying To Vercel

This repo is structured as a monorepo, so deploy it as **two Vercel projects**:

1. **Backend project**
   Root Directory: `backend`
2. **Frontend project**
   Root Directory: `frontend`

### Backend project settings

- Framework Preset: `Other`
- Root Directory: `backend`
- Required environment variables:
  - `MONGODB_URI`
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY`
  - `KIMI_API_KEY`
  - `CLIENT_URL` = your deployed frontend URL
  - `DB_FALLBACK_MODE` = `disabled`

After deploy, your API base URL will look like:

```bash
https://your-backend-project.vercel.app/api
```

### Frontend project settings

- Framework Preset: `Vite`
- Root Directory: `frontend`
- Required environment variables:
  - `VITE_API_BASE_URL` = `https://your-backend-project.vercel.app/api`

The frontend includes a `vercel.json` rewrite so React Router routes such as `/history` work in production.

### Important Vercel notes

- Vercel Functions are **ephemeral**, so local file storage is not suitable for production history.
- This app now expects **MongoDB** in production.
- Image OCR uploads are handled in memory so they can run inside a serverless function.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/doubts/solve` | Solve a doubt (text/image) |
| `GET` | `/api/doubts/history` | Get past doubts (paginated) |
| `GET` | `/api/doubts/:id` | Get single doubt details |
| `POST` | `/api/doubts/:id/followup` | Ask a follow-up question |
| `DELETE` | `/api/doubts/:id` | Delete a doubt |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Health check |

---

## 🧠 Adaptive Answer Modes

Doubtly now formats responses differently depending on the detected or selected question type:

| Type | Response Style |
|------|----------------|
| `coding` | Problem understanding, solution strategy, runnable code, code walkthrough, and complexity notes |
| `math` | Step-by-step derivation, formula reasoning, and final result |
| `reasoning` | Given clues, deduction flow, elimination logic, and final conclusion |
| `science` | Concept explanation, core principle, and structured answer |
| `theory` | Clear notes, real-world intuition, and exam-ready summary |
| `general` | Clean structured explanation with key concepts and final answer |

Users can explicitly choose a category on the solver page, and the backend also applies lightweight question-type detection when the category is left broad.

---

## 🤖 AI Model Routing & Caching

Doubtly utilizes a dual-model approach along with in-memory caching to optimize both response quality and API costs.

### Caching
All AI explanations and follow-ups are cached using `node-cache` (1-hour TTL). If a user asks the exact same question or follow-up, Doubtly serves the response instantly from memory, avoiding duplicate API calls.

### Model Routing
| Provider | Model | Best For | 
|----------|-------|----------|
| Gemini | `gemini-2.0-flash` | Fast, structured math/reasoning/science/general explanations |
| Kimi | `moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct` | Coding-heavy tasks and detailed theory/follow-up answers |

The chosen model is stored with each saved doubt (`aiProvider`, `aiModel`) so follow-ups and practice questions continue using the same model that solved the original doubt.
